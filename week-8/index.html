<h2>OAuth</h2>

<p>
  OAuth is a way to sign into to use a provider, like Facebook, SoundCloud,
  Spotify, etc. on behalf of a particular user and access data that they have
  access to. It has to be done this way because those services could never
  just give you access to their whole database. Instead you are gaining access
  to a portion of the data (whatever access that login can access).
</p>

<p>
  Here's a diagram of what OAuth looks like in action:

  As you can see it's pretty complicated. So to that end, we'll try and use
  libraries that do the OAuth for us. The Facebook SDK is an example of that.
